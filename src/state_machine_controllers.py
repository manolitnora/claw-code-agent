"""Concrete Controller implementations for the state machine.

Step 5 of the runway in ``~/.latti/STATE_MACHINE.md``: Controllers pick the
next Action given a State. Rule-based controllers fire on known-shape
transitions (cheap, deterministic). LLM-based controllers handle ambiguity
(expensive, non-deterministic). Compose via ``FallbackController`` so the
rule path is tried first and the LLM is reached only when no rule matched.

A Controller returns a typed ``PolicyDecision`` (not a bare Action) so the
runner records rationale + decided_by metadata with every choice.
